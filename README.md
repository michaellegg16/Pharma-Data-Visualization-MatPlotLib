### Task

* Use artificial data of a scientific study on drug effectiveness on reducing tumor sizes in mice.
* Specifically, compare the regimen Capomulin against other treatments.
* The following results have been calculated:

* A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

* A bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the number of data points for each treatment regimen.

* A pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

* Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. 
* Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

* Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens

* Generate a line plot of time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.



* Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

* Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. 
* Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
